## Introduction

This is a multiplayer blackjack game played from command line. The game is developed just for fun and for my personal skill development. I also had an intention to create automated players based on Reinforcement Learning and probabilistic/statistical methods. But they are not implemented yet.


### Game features:
Multiplayer game </br>
The initial balance for each player is $500.</br>
The lowest bet is $5.</br>
Additional bet can be placed before each hitting action.</br>
All initial bets and additional bets need to be integer.</br>
The number of card deck is 6 and is shuffled in the beginning and when total number of picked cards exceeds a particular number which is selected randomly after each shuffle.</br>

If you dont insert any name, the names will automatically be placed as 'player-1', 'player-2' etc.</br>

I hope you enjoy the game. Please let me know if you want to improve it further or add additional features to the game or even want to develop an UI. I will be happy to co-operate.
